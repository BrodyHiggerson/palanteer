This folder contains the Python scripting module.

Installation
============

Requires that `setuptools` is installed (comes with pip).

You can either:

1) Install all `Palanteer` components with CMake (see ./INSTALL.md) <br/>
   Indeed, this library is part of the global installation (target "python_instrumentation"). <br/>
   The installation in this case is for the current user only, so that no privilege rights are required.

or

2) Run the command below from this folder: <br/>
     `python setup.py install --user`    (for current user only) <br/>
or <br/>
     `python setup.py install`           (for all users, it requires root privilege on Linux) <br/>


Usage
=====

Please refer to the Palanteer documentation.
